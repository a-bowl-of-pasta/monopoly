there are 2 main methods, a client and server main. 
this is where the client's main is going to be held.
this is also where the client side of the server will be handled
there is not much logic to be done here, this is mostly just the driver classes


:: the classes are :: 

- clientMain - 

this is the where the main method is, it will handle server connection
and potentially the player's GUI
there are two central methods, autoConnect and manualConnect. 
AutoConnect is going to attempt to try to connect to server without the user having to input port# or anything. 
if autoconnect fails, manual connect will connect by having them enter the port# and etc. 

- gameClient - 

this is the class that handles sending and recieveing messages from the server.
it is what connects to the server.
